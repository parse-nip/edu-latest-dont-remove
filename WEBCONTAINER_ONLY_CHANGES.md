# WebContainer-Only Changes

## Summary
Removed Daytona completely and switched to WebContainer-only preview system with proper file writing and execution.

## Changes Made

### 1. **src/hooks/useChat.ts**
- ✅ Removed Daytona imports
- ✅ Changed `updateLivePreview` to use WebContainer only
- ✅ No more Daytona sandbox creation or fallback

### 2. **src/components/chat/SimplePreview.tsx**
- ✅ Removed blob URL generation
- ✅ Now uses WebContainer preview URLs directly
- ✅ Simpler, cleaner preview logic

### 3. **src/lib/runners/universal-runner.ts**
- ✅ Enhanced `runAppWebContainer` to:
  - Write all files to WebContainer file system
  - Install dependencies (npm install)
  - Start the dev server
  - Return proper WebContainer preview URL

### 4. **src/app/universal-builder/page.tsx**
- ✅ Removed Daytona initialization
- ✅ Cleaner component without Daytona dependencies

## How It Works Now

1. **AI generates files** → Files are created in memory
2. **Files written to WebContainer** → All files written to WebContainer file system
3. **Dependencies installed** → `npm install` runs in WebContainer
4. **Dev server starts** → `npm start` runs in WebContainer
5. **Preview URL returned** → WebContainer exposes the running app on localhost:3000
6. **iframe shows preview** → The preview iframe displays the WebContainer URL

## Benefits

- ✅ No blob URLs - uses real WebContainer server
- ✅ No Daytona dependency - works entirely in browser
- ✅ Proper npm install and start process
- ✅ Real dev server with hot reload support
- ✅ Simpler, more reliable architecture

## Testing

Try generating a "calculator app" and you should see:
1. Console logs showing files being written
2. npm install running
3. npm start launching the dev server
4. Preview iframe showing the actual running app at localhost:3000

## Note

The OpenRouter API is configured and the API key is present in .env.local. If you're still seeing fallback simulations, make sure the API key is valid at https://openrouter.ai
